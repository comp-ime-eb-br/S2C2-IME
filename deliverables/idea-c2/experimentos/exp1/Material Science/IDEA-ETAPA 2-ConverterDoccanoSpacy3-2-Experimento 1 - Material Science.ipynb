In situ EXAFS measurements under water gas shift conditions show that the active form of gold is a small gold cluster in intimate contact with the oxide support . the importance of the gold / oxide interface is indicated but the possible role of special sites ( e.g. , edge sites ) on the gold clusters can not be excluded . these may be important for CO oxidation but the fact that water has to be activated in the water gas shift reaction may point towards a more dominant role for the interfacial sites . the mechanism of the water gas shift reaction on gold and other low temperature catalysts has been widely investigated but little agreement exists . however , it is shown that a single “ universal ” model is consistent with much of the experimental literature . In this , it is proposed that the dominant surface intermediate is a function of reaction conditions . for example , as the temperature is increased the dominant species changes from a carbonate or carboxylate species , to a formate species and eventually at high temperatures to a mechanism that is characteristic of a redox process . similar changes in the dominant intermediate are observed with changes in the gas composition . overall , it is shown that reported variations in the kinetics , structure and reaction mechanism for the water gas shift reaction on gold catalysts can now be understood and rationalised . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: aminoclay : a permselective matrix to stabilize copper nanoparticles . air sensitive copper nanoparticles have been stabilized using a water soluble aminoclay matrix . the aminoclay shows remarkable permselective behaviour allowing only the ionic species to diffuse through it and react with copper nanoparticles . it blocks the neutral molecule oxygen , thereby stabilizing the copper nanoparticles against oxidation for a longer period . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: A rapid synthesis of high aspect ratio copper nanowires for high - performance transparent conducting films . this communication presents a way to produce copper nanowires with aspect ratios as high as <nUm> in <nUm> min , and describes the growth processes responsible for their formation . these nanowires were used to make transparent conducting films with a transmittance > <nUm> % at a sheet resistance < <nUm> Ω sq-1 . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: oxygen vacancy related defect dipoles in CaCu3O12Ti4 : detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy . oxygen vacancy associate defects were studied by electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) for the perovskite oxide CaCu3O12Ti4 ( CCTO ) , which have a colossal dielectric constant . it is found that the EPR line width of the cu2+ – host signal of CCTO correlates with its permittivity .

Au atoms inclusion in the cluster increases the binding energy and vertical ionization potential , indicating higher stability as the number of Au atoms grows . the variation of chemical hardness with the composition in a cluster with the same size shows peaks when the number of Ag atoms is greater than or equal to Au ones , corresponding to transition from planar to tri-dimensional structures . for clusters with even number of atoms , the peaks indicate that the clusters with the same number of Ag and Au atoms are the most stable ones . analyzing the density of states , we found that increasing the concentration of Ag atoms affects the energy separation between the HOMO and the low lying occupied states . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: temperature and pressure dependent electrical property of Fe2O3 nanorod .

step method , which combines the hydrothermal growth of Fe2O3 nanoparticles and the microemulsion phase of brij <nUm> ( C16EO10 ) surfactant as templates in instantly direct - templating synthesis . this synthesis method enables the fabrication of mesoporous Fe2O3 / O2Si nanocomposites without distortion of the ordered porous structure after calcination at high temperature . the synthesised materials were found to be efficient in a room temperature VOC sensor application , with good recovery . \n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\r100%|██████████| 196/196 [00:00<00:00, 256.53it/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["erros de spans: 0\n"]}],"source":["#from auxiliares import train_test_split_total\n","#from conversao_json_spacy_completo import conversao_jsonl_spacy\n","\n","# Nesse trecho de código foi inserida a Validação Cruzada para Entidades\n","\n","TOTAL_JSONL_PATH = DATA_FILE_PATH_IN\n","PERCENT_SPLIT_TEST = 0.7\n","PERCENT_SPLIT_DEV = 0.3\n","\n","#Variável que permite dividir o conjunto de dados por X pedaços.\n","# Isto é, se tiver um arquivo com 1000 registros,\n","# e a varíavel estiver \"setada\" para 4, serão gerados 4 arquivos com 250 registros em cada.\n","NR_FOLDS = 1\n","\n","# São divididos o conjunto de dados em 3 partes (teste, treino e dev)\n","TEST_PATH = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/preanotetool/output/corpus_2_quimicos_RE-test\"\n","TRAIN_PATH =  \"/content/drive/MyDrive/preanotetool/output/corpus_2_quimicos_RE-train\"\n","DEV_PATH = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/preanotetool/output/corpus_2_quimicos_RE-dev\"\n","\n","# dev_jsonl_path = DEV_PATH + \".jsonl\"\n","# dev_spacy_path = DEV_PATH + \".spacy\"\n","# train_jsonl_path = TRAIN_PATH + \".jsonl\"\n","# train_spacy_path = TRAIN_PATH + \".spacy\"\n","\n","test_jsonl_path = TEST_PATH + \".jsonl\"\n","test_spacy_path = TEST_PATH + \".spacy\"\n","\n","\n","# Cria um arquivo temporário que não é utilizado\n","temp_path = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/preanotetool/output/exporta_anotacao-temp.jsonl\"\n","\n","# Separando conjunto de teste dos demais (temp)\n","train_test_split_total(TOTAL_JSONL_PATH, PERCENT_SPLIT_TEST, temp_path, test_jsonl_path)\n","\n","#REMOVIDO PARA FACILITAR DEPOIS TEM QUE SER REATIVADO\n","#train_test_split_total(TOTAL_JSONL_PATH, PERCENT_SPLIT_TEST, train_jsonl_path, test_jsonl_path)\n","\n","# Convertendo jsonl para spacy  (conjunto de teste)\n","#conversao_jsonl_spacy(train_jsonl_path, train_spacy_path)\n","\n","conversao_jsonl_spacy(test_jsonl_path, test_spacy_path)\n","####valida_conversao_jsonl_spacy(test_jsonl_path, test_spacy_path)\n","\n","#print(train_jsonl_path)\n","#print(test_jsonl_path)\n","\n","# Criando pares de conjuntos train+dev para cada fold\n","for fold in range(NR_FOLDS):\n","    print(fold)\n","\n","    train_jsonl_path_k = TRAIN_PATH + str(fold) + \".jsonl\"\n","    train_spacy_path_k = TRAIN_PATH + str(fold) + \".spacy\"\n","    dev_jsonl_path_k = DEV_PATH + str(fold) + \".jsonl\"\n","    dev_spacy_path_k = DEV_PATH + str(fold) + \".spacy\"\n","\n","    # Separando conjuntos train e dev\n","    train_test_split_total(temp_path, PERCENT_SPLIT_DEV, train_jsonl_path_k, dev_jsonl_path_k)\n","\n","    # Convertendo jsonl para spacy  (conjunto train)\n","    conversao_jsonl_spacy(train_jsonl_path_k, train_spacy_path_k)\n","\n","    # Convertendo jsonl para spacy  (conjunto dev)\n","    conversao_jsonl_spacy(dev_jsonl_path_k, dev_spacy_path_k)"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"machine_shape":"hm","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
