Typically, information that makes it to a  summary  appears in many different  lexical-syntactic forms  in the input  documents  . Further, the use of multiple  machine translation systems  provides yet more  redundancy  , yielding different ways to realize that  information  in  English  . We demonstrate how errors in the  machine translations  of the input  Arabic documents  can be corrected by identifying and generating from such  redundancy  , focusing on  noun phrases  . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:    Interpreting  metaphors  is an integral and inescapable process in  human understanding of natural language  . This paper discusses a  method of analyzing metaphors  based on the existence of a small number of  generalized metaphor mappings  . Each  generalized metaphor  contains a  recognition network  , a  basic mapping  , additional  transfer mappings  , and an  implicit intention component  . It is argued that the method reduces  metaphor interpretation  from a  reconstruction  to a  recognition task  . Implications towards automating certain aspects of  language learning  are also discussed. \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  Past work of generating  referring expressions  mainly utilized attributes of  objects  and  binary relations  between  objects . However, such an approach does not work well when there is no distinctive attribute among  objects . To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a method utilizing the perceptual groups of  objects  and  n-ary relations  among them. The key is to identify groups of  objects  that are naturally recognized by humans. We conducted psychological experiments with 42 subjects to collect  referring expressions  in such situations, and built a  generation algorithm  based on the results. The evaluation using another 23 subjects showed that the proposed method could effectively generate proper referring expressions. \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: We study the number of hidden layers required by a multilayer neu-ral network with threshold units to compute a function f from n d to {O, I}. In dimension d = 2, Gibson characterized the functions computable with just one hidden layer, under the assumption that there is no \"multiple intersection point\" and that f is only defined on a compact set. We consider the restriction of f to the neighborhood of a multiple intersection point or of infinity, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be locally computable with one hidden layer. We show that adding these conditions to Gib-son's assumptions is not sufficient to ensure global computability with one hidden layer, by exhibiting a new non-local configuration, the \"critical cycle\", which implies that f is not computable with one hidden layer.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  A novel  bootstrapping approach  to  Named Entity (NE) tagging  using  concept-based seeds  and  successive learners  is presented.

At the core of the externally digital architecture is a high-density, low-power analog array performing binary-binary partial matrix-vector multiplication. Full digital resolution is maintained even with low-resolution analog-to-digital conversion, owing to random statistics in the analog summation of binary products. A random modulation scheme produces near-Bernoulli statistics even for highly correlated inputs. The approach is validated with real image data, and with experimental results from a CID/DRAM analog array prototype in 0.5 ¢ m CMOS.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Visitors who browse the web from wireless PDAs, cell phones, and pagers are frequently stymied by web interfaces optimized for desktop PCs. Simply replacing graphics with text and reformatting tables does not solve the problem, because deep link structures can still require minutes to traverse. In this paper we develop an algorithm, MINPATH, that automatically improves wireless web navigation by suggesting useful shortcut links in real time. MINPATH finds shortcuts by using a learned model of web visitor behavior to estimate the savings of shortcut links, and suggests only the few best links. We explore a variety of predictive models, including Na¨ıve Bayes mixture models and mixtures of Markov models, and report empirical evidence that MINPATH finds useful shortcuts that save substantial navigational effort.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  In this paper, we present a  corpus-based supervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) system  for  Dutch  which combines  statistical classification  ( maximum entropy ) with  linguistic information . Instead of building individual  classifiers  per  ambiguous wordform , we introduce a  lemma-based approach . The advantage of this novel method is that it clusters all  inflected forms  of an  ambiguous word  in one  classifier , therefore augmenting the  training material  available to the  algorithm . Testing the  lemma-based model  on the  Dutch Senseval-2 test data , we achieve a significant increase in  accuracy  over the  wordform model . Also, the  WSD system based on lemmas  is smaller and more robust. \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: We investigated whether automatic phonetic transcriptions (APTs) can replace manually verified phonetic transcriptions (MPTs) in a large corpus-based study on pronunciation variation. To this end, we compared the performance of both transcription types in a classification experiment aimed at establishing the direct influence of a particular situational setting on pronunciation variation. We trained classifiers on the speech processes extracted from the alignments of an APT and an MPT with a canonical transcription. We tested whether the classifiers were equally good at verifying whether unknown transcriptions represent read speech or telephone dialogues, and whether the same speech processes were identified to distinguish between transcriptions of the two situational settings. Our results not only show that similar distinguishing speech processes were identified; our APT-based classifier yielded better classification accuracy than the MPT-based classifier whilst using fewer classification features.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Two main classes of approaches have been studied to perform monocular nonrigid 3D reconstruction: Template-based methods and Non-rigid Structure from Motion techniques. While the first ones have been applied to reconstruct poorly-textured surfaces, they assume the availability of a 3D shape model prior to reconstruction. By contrast, the second ones do not require such a shape template, but, instead, rely on points being tracked throughout a video sequence, and are thus ill-suited to handle poorly-textured surfaces. In this paper, we introduce a template-free approach to reconstructing a poorly-textured, deformable surface. To this end, we leverage surface isometry and formulate 3D reconstruction as the joint problem of non-rigid image registration and depth estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach yields much more accurate 3D reconstructions than state-of-the-art techniques.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Human action recognition from well-segmented 3D skeleton data has been intensively studied and attracting an increasing attention. Online action detection goes one step further and is more challenging, which identifies the action type and localizes the action positions on the fly from the untrimmed stream. In this paper, we study the problem of online action detection from the streaming skeleton data. We propose a multi-task end-to-end Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network to better explore the action type and temporal localiza-tion information. By employing a joint classification and regression optimization objective, this network is capable of automatically localizing the start and end points of actions more accurately. Specifically, by leveraging the merits of the deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) subnetwork, the proposed model automatically captures the complex long-range temporal dynamics, which naturally avoids the typical sliding window design and thus ensures high computational efficiency. Furthermore, the subtask of regression optimization provides the ability to forecast the action prior to its occurrence. To evaluate our proposed model, we build a large streaming video dataset with annotations. Experimental results on our dataset and the public G3D dataset both demonstrate very promising performance of our scheme.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: We present a method for estimating the relative pose of two calibrated or uncalibrated non-overlapping surveillance cameras from observing a moving object. We show how to tackle the problem of missing point correspondences heavily required by SfM pipelines and how to go beyond this basic paradigm. We relax the non-linear nature of the problem by accepting two assumptions which surveillance scenarios offer, ie. the presence of a moving object and easily estimable gravity vector. By those assumptions we cast the problem as a Quadratic Eigenvalue Problem offering an elegant way of treating nonlinear monomials and delivering a quasi closed-form solution as a reliable starting point for a further bundle adjustment. We are the first to bring the closed form solution to such a very practical problem arising in video surveillance. Results in different camera setups demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:   Pipelined Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems  have grown increasingly complex as  architectural modules  were added to support  language functionalities  such as  referring expressions ,  lexical choice , and  revision .

However, most of the existing training methods are designed by assuming that data can be stored in the computer memory. These methods cannot be easily applied to data larger than the memory capacity due to the random access to the disk. We propose and analyze a block minimization framework for data larger than the memory size. At each step a block of data is loaded from the disk and handled by certain learning methods. We investigate two implementations of the proposed framework for primal and dual SVMs, respectively. As data cannot fit in memory, many design considerations are very different from those for traditional algorithms. Experiments using data sets 20 times larger than the memory demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:   CriterionSM Online Essay Evaluation Service  includes a capability that labels  sentences  in student  writing  with  essay-based discourse elements  (e.g.,  thesis statements  ).

In this paper, we propose to concentrate on correcting the positions in which the words in the list appear by taking a word as a correction unit. This method allows us to avoid these problems and go directly to capturing the statistical behavior of specific words in the application.

Over the last decade, a variety of  SMT algorithms  have been built and empirically tested whereas little is known about the  computational complexity  of some of the fundamental problems of  SMT  . Our work aims at providing useful insights into the the  computational complexity  of those problems. We prove that while  IBM Models 1-2  are conceptually and computationally simple, computations involving the higher (and more useful)  models  are  hard  . Since it is unlikely that there exists a  polynomial time solution  for any of these  hard problems  (unless  P = NP  and  P#P = P  ), our results highlight and justify the need for developing  polynomial time approximations  for these computations.

Because a  speaker  and  listener  cannot be assured to have the same  beliefs  ,  contexts  ,  perceptions  ,  backgrounds  , or  goals  , at each point in a  conversation  , difficulties and mistakes arise when a  listener  interprets a  speaker's utterance  . These mistakes can lead to various kinds of misunderstandings between  speaker  and  listener  , including  reference failures  or failure to understand the  speaker's intention  . We call these misunderstandings  miscommunication  . Such mistakes can slow, and possibly break down,  communication  . Our goal is to recognize and isolate such  miscommunications  and circumvent them. This paper highlights a particular class of  miscommunication  ---  reference problems  --- by describing a case study and techniques for avoiding  failures of reference  . We want to illustrate a framework less restrictive than earlier ones by allowing a  speaker  leeway in forming an  utterance  about a task and in determining the conversational vehicle to deliver it.

To handle this problem, we propose a new method, called adaptive dither voting, for robust spatial verification. For each correspondence , instead of hard-mapping it to a single transformation , the method augments its description by using multiple dithered transformations that are deterministically generated by the other correspondences. The method reduces the probability of losing correspondences during transformation quantization, and provides high robustness as regards mismatches by imposing three geometric constraints on the dithering process. We also propose exploiting the non-uniformity of a Hough histogram as the spatial similarity to handle multiple matching surfaces. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets show the superiority of our method. The method outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts in both accuracy and scalability, especially when it comes to the retrieval of small, rotated objects.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We describe an implementation of data-driven selection of emphatic facial displays for an  embodied conversational agent  in a  dialogue system .

In this model, on-line handwriting is considered as a modulation of a simple cycloidal pen motion, described by two coupled oscillations with a constant linear drift along the line of the writing. By slow modulations of the amplitudes and phase lags of the two oscillators, a general pen trajectory can be efficiently encoded. These parameters are then quantized into a small number of values without altering the writing intelligibility. A general procedure for the estimation and quantization of these cycloidal motion parameters for arbitrary handwriting is presented. The result is a discrete motor control representation of the continuous pen motion, via the quantized levels of the model parameters. This motor control representation enables successful word spotting and matching of cursive scripts. Our experiments clearly indicate the potential of this dynamic representation for complete cursive handwriting recognition.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: The construction of causal graphs from non-experimental data rests on a set of constraints that the graph structure imposes on all probability distributions compatible with the graph. These constraints are of two types: conditional inde-pendencies and algebraic constraints, first noted by Verma. While conditional independencies are well studied and frequently used in causal induction algorithms, Verma constraints are still poorly understood, and rarely applied. In this paper we examine a special subset of Verma constraints which are easy to understand, easy to identify and easy to apply ; they arise from \" dormant independencies, \" namely, conditional independencies that hold in interventional distributions. We give a complete algorithm for determining if a dormant independence between two sets of variables is entailed by the causal graph, such that this independence is identifiable , in other words if it resides in an interventional distribution that can be predicted without resorting to interventions. We further show the usefulness of dormant independencies in model testing and induction by giving an algorithm that uses constraints entailed by dormant independencies to prune extraneous edges from a given causal graph.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:    An  entity-oriented approach to restricted-domain parsing  is proposed.

The combination of these two strategies results in a robust estimation procedure that provides a significant speed-up over existing RANSAC techniques, while requiring no prior information to guide the sampling process. In particular, our algorithm requires, on average, 3-10 times fewer samples than standard RANSAC, which is in close agreement with theoretical predictions.

The proposed algorithm is based on a statistical model of short-term log-energy sequences for echo-free speech. Given a speech utterance recorded in a reverberant room, it computes a Maximum Likelihood estimate of the room full-band reverberation time. The estimation method is shown to require little data and to perform satisfactorily. The method has been successfully applied to robust automatic speech recognition in reverberant environments by model selection. For this application, the reverberation time is first estimated from the reverberated speech utterance to be recognized. The estimation is then used to select the best acoustic model out of a library of models trained in various artificial re-verberant conditions. Speech recognition experiments in simulated and real reverberant environments show the efficiency of our approach which outperforms standard channel normaliza-tion techniques.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Representing images with layers has many important applications , such as video compression, motion analysis, and 3D scene analysis. This paper presents an approach to reliably extracting layers from images by taking advantages of the fact that homographies induced by planar patches in the scene form a low dimensional linear subspace. Layers in the input images will be mapped in the subspace, where it is proven that they form well-defined clusters and can be reliably identified by a simple mean-shift based clustering algorithm. Global optimality is achieved since all valid regions are simultaneously taken into account, and noise can be effectively reduced by enforcing the subspace constraint. Good layer descriptions are shown to be extracted in the experimental results.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: The perception of transparent objects from images is known to be a very hard problem in vision. Given a single image, it is difficult to even detect the presence of transparent objects in the scene. In this paper, we explore what can be said about transparent objects by a moving observer. We show how features that are imaged through a transparent object behave differently from those that are rigidly attached to the scene. We present a novel model-based approach to recover the shapes and the poses of transparent objects from known motion. The objects can be complex in that they may be composed of multiple layers with different refractive indices. We have conducted numerous simulations to verify the practical feasibility of our algorithm. We have applied it to real scenes that include transparent objects and recovered the shapes of the objects with high accuracy. \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Image composition (or mosaicing) has attracted a growing attention in recent years as one of the main elements in video analysis and representation. In this paper we deal with the problem of global alignment and super-resolution. We also propose to evaluate the quality of the resulting mosaic by measuring the amount of blurring. Global registration is achieved by combining a graph-based technique – that exploits the topological structure of the sequence induced by the spatial overlap – with a bundle adjustment which uses only the homographies computed in the previous steps. Experimental comparison with other techniques shows the effectiveness of our approach.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: We present a novel algorithm for estimating the broad 3D geometric structure of outdoor video scenes. Leveraging spatio-temporal video segmentation, we decompose a dynamic scene captured by a video into geometric classes, based on predictions made by region-classifiers that are trained on appearance and motion features.

We built a novel, extensive dataset on geometric context of video to evaluate our method, consisting of over 100 ground-truth annotated outdoor videos with over 20,000 frames.

We consider perceptual sound organization as a scene analysis problem in the auditory domain. Our model consists of multiple processing modules and a hypothesis network for quantitative integration of multiple sources of information. When input information for each processing module is available, the module rises to process it and asynchronously writes output information to the hypothesis network. On the hypothesis network, individual information is integrated and an optimal internal model of perceptual sounds is automatically constructed. Based on the model, a music scene analysis system has been developed for acoustic signals of ensemble music, which recognizes rhythm, chords, and source-separated musical notes.

A novel feature of our approach is that it is completely unsupervised and requires no a priori linguistic or phonetic knowledge.

These applications require high accuracy for the estimation of the motion field since the most interesting parameters of the dynamical processes studied are contained in first-order derivatives of the motion field or in dynamical changes of the moving objects. Therefore the performance and optimization of low-level motion estimators is discussed. A tensor method tuned with carefully optimized derivative filters yields reliable and dense displacement vector fields (DVF) with an accuracy of up to a few hundredth pixels/frame for real-world images. The accuracy of the tensor method is verified with computer-generated sequences and a calibrated image sequence. With the improvements in accuracy the motion estimation is now rather limited by imperfections in the CCD sensors, especially the spatial nonuni-formity in the responsivity. With a simple two-point calibration, these effects can efficiently be suppressed. The application of the techniques to the analysis of plant growth, to ocean surface microturbulence in IR image sequences, and to sediment transport is demonstrated.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  This paper proposes a novel method of building  polarity-tagged corpus  from  HTML documents  .

During normal tracking conditions when the object is visible from frame to frame, local optimization is used to track the local mode of the similarity measure in a parameter space of translation, rotation and scale. However, when the object becomes partially or totally occluded, such local tracking is prone to failure, especially when common prediction techniques like the Kalman filter do not provide a good estimate of object parameters in future frames. To recover from these inevitable tracking failures, we consider object detection as a global optimization problem and solve it via Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA), a method that avoids becoming trapped at local modes and is much faster than exhaustive search. As a Monte Carlo approach, ASA stochastically samples the parameter space, in contrast to local deterministic search. We apply cluster analysis on the sampled parameter space to redetect the object and renew the local tracker. Our numerical hybrid local and global mode-seeking tracker is validated on challenging airborne videos with heavy occlusion and large camera motions.

Fortunately, an intermediate domain could often be found to build a bridge across them to facilitate the learning problem. In this paper, we propose a Coupled Marginalized Denoising Auto-encoders framework to address the cross-domain problem. Specifically, we design two marginalized denoising auto-encoders, one for the target and the other for source as well as the intermediate one. To better couple the two denoising auto-encoders learning, we incorporate a feature mapping, which tends to transfer knowledge between the intermediate domain and the target one. Furthermore, the maximum margin criterion, e.g., intra-class com-pactness and inter-class penalty, on the output layer is imposed to seek more discriminative features across different domains.

Existing works in the field usually do not encode either the temporal evolution or the intensity of the observed facial displays. They also fail to jointly model multidimensional (multi-class) continuous facial behaviour data; binary classifiers-one for each target basic-emotion class-are used instead. In this paper, intrinsic topology of multidimensional continuous facial affect data is first modeled by an ordinal man-ifold. This topology is then incorporated into the Hidden Conditional Ordinal Random Field (H-CORF) framework for dynamic ordinal regression by constraining H-CORF parameters to lie on the ordinal manifold. The resulting model attains simultaneous dynamic recognition and intensity estimation of facial expressions of multiple emotions. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first one to achieve this on both deliberate as well as spontaneous facial affect data.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: We propose a novel approach to associate objects across multiple PTZ cameras that can be used to perform camera handoff in wide-area surveillance scenarios. While previous approaches relied on geometric, appearance, or correlation-based information for establishing correspondences between static cameras, they each have well-known limitations and are not extendable to wide-area settings with PTZ cameras. In our approach, the slave camera only passively follows the target (by loose registration with the master) and bootstraps itself from its own incoming imagery , thus effectively circumventing the problems faced by previous approaches and avoiding the need to perform any model transfer. Towards this goal, we also propose a novel Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) formulation for the problem based on the logistic softmax function of covariance-based region features within a MAP estimation framework. We demonstrate our approach with multiple PTZ camera sequences in typical outdoor surveillance settings and show a comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: This paper presents an algorithm for computing optical flow, shape, motion, lighting, and albedo from an image sequence of a rigidly-moving Lambertian object under distant illumination.

The algorithm utilizes both spatial and temporal intensity variation as cues: the former constrains flow and the latter constrains surface orientation ; combining both cues enables dense reconstruction of both textured and texture-less surfaces. The algorithm works by iteratively estimating affine camera parameters, illumination , shape, and albedo in an alternating fashion.

Little is thus known about the robustness of speech cues in the wild. This study compares the effect of noise and reverberation on depression prediction using 1) standard mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and 2) features designed for noise robustness, damped oscillator cepstral coefficients (DOCCs). Data come from the 2014 AudioVisual Emotion Recognition Challenge (AVEC). Results using additive noise and reverberation reveal a consistent pattern of findings for multiple evaluation metrics under both matched and mismatched conditions. First and most notably: standard MFCC features suffer dramatically under test/train mismatch for both noise and reverberation; DOCC features are far more robust. Second, including higher-order cepstral coefficients is generally beneficial. Third, artificial neural networks tend to outperform support vector regression. Fourth, spontaneous speech appears to offer better robustness than read speech. Finally, a cross-corpus (and cross-language) experiment reveals better noise and reverberation robustness for DOCCs than for MFCCs. Implications and future directions for real-world robust depression detection are discussed.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  This paper defines a  generative probabilistic model  of  parse trees , which we call  PCFG-LA .

Our strategy is based on a hierarchical abstraction of the supervoxel graph that allows us to minimize an energy defined at the finest level of the hierarchy by minimizing a series of simpler energies defined over coarser graphs. The strategy is exact, i.e., it produces the same solution as minimizing over the finest graph. It is general, i.e., it can be used to minimize any energy function (e.g., unary, pairwise, and higher-order terms) with any existing energy minimization algorithm (e.g., graph cuts and belief propagation). It also gives significant speedups in inference for several datasets with varying degrees of spatio-temporal continuity. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our strategy relative to existing hierarchical approaches, and the kinds of image and video data that provide the best speedups.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: In the study of expressive speech communication, it is commonly accepted that the emotion perceived by the listener is a good approximation of the intended emotion conveyed by the speaker. This paper analyzes the validity of this assumption by comparing the mismatches between the assessments made by na¨ıve listeners and by the speakers that generated the data. The analysis is based on the hypothesis that people are better decoders of their own emotions. Therefore, self-assessments will be closer to the intended emotions. Using the IEMOCAP database, discrete (categorical) and continuous (attribute) emotional assessments evaluated by the actors and na¨ıve listeners are compared. The results indicate that there is a mismatch between the expression and perception of emotion. The speakers in the database assigned their own emotions to more specific emotional categories, which led to more extreme values in the activation-valence space.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  The applicability of many current  information extraction techniques  is severely limited by the need for  supervised training data .

The GNSS/INS coupling is usually performed by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which yields an accurate and robust localization. However , interference cause the GNSS measurement noise to increase unexpectedly, hence degrade the positioning accuracy. In this context , our contribution is twofold. We first study the impact of the GNSS noise inflation on the covariance of the EKF outputs so as to compute a least square estimate of the potential variance jumps. Then, this estimation is used in a Bayesian test which decides whether interference are corrupting the GNSS signal or not. It allows us to estimate their times of occurrence as well. In this way, the impaired measurements can be discarded while their impact on the navigation solution can be compensated. The results show the performance of the proposed approach on simulated data.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  Reducing  language model (LM) size  is a critical issue when applying a  LM  to realistic applications which have memory constraints.

Fluorescence is a common phenomenon occurring in many objects from natural gems and corals, to fluorescent dyes used in clothing. One of the important characteristics of fluorescence is its wavelength-shifting behavior: fluorescent materials absorb light at a certain wavelength and then reemit it at longer wavelengths. Due to the complexity of its emission process, fluo-rescence tends to be excluded from most algorithms in computer vision and image processing. In this paper, we show that there is a strong similarity between fluorescence and ideal diffuse reflection and that fluorescence can provide distinct clues on how to estimate an object's shape. Moreover , fluorescence's wavelength-shifting property enables us to estimate the shape of an object by applying photomet-ric stereo to emission-only images without suffering from specular reflection. This is the significant advantage of the fluorescence-based method over previous methods based on reflection.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:    This paper introduces a robust  interactive method for speech understanding  . The  generalized LR parsing  is enhanced in this approach.  Parsing  proceeds from left to right correcting minor errors.

Building such a representation requires the capability to register all the frames with respect to the dominant object in the scene, a task which has been, in the past, addressed through temporally localized motion estimates. In this paper, we show how the lack of temporal consistency associated with such estimates can undermine the validity of the dominant motion assumption, leading to oscillation between different scene interpretations and poor registration. To avoid this oscillation, we augment the motion model with a generic temporal constraint which increases the robustness against competing interpretations, leading to more meaningful content summarization.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  The major objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate robust, high performance  continuous speech recognition (CSR) techniques  focussed on application in  Spoken Language Systems (SLS)  which will enhance the effectiveness of  military and civilian computer-based systems .

Most existing algorithms require the prior knowledge of intrinsic parameters of the PTZ camera to infer the relative positioning and orientation among multiple PTZ cameras. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mapping algorithm that derives the relative positioning and orientation between two PTZ cameras based on a unified polynomial model. This reduces the dependence on the knowledge of intrinsic parameters of PTZ camera and relative positions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm presents substantially reduced computational complexity and improved flexibility at the cost of slightly decreased pixel accuracy, as compared with the work of Chen and Wang. This slightly decreased pixel accuracy can be compensated by consistent labeling approaches without added cost for the application of automated surveillance systems along with changing configurations and a larger number of PTZ cameras.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: This paper presents a new two-pass algorithm for Extra Large (more than 1M words) Vocabulary COntinuous Speech recognition based on the Information Retrieval (ELVIRCOS).

Projective reconstruction refers to a determination of the 3D geometrical configuration of a set of 3D points and cameras, given only correspondences between points in the images. A configuration of points and cameras is critical if it can not be determined uniquely (up to a projective transform) from the image coordinates of the points. It is shown that a configuration consisting of any number of cameras lying on a straight line, and any number of points lying on a twisted cubic constitutes a critical configuration. An alternative configuration consisting of a set of points and cameras all lying on a rational quartic curve exists.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Despite their success, convolutional neural networks are computationally expensive because they must examine all image locations.

These are mainly attributable to the simplifying assumptions made about the excitation source, which are usually required to maintain such low bit rates. In this paper a new LPC vocoder is presented which splits the LPC excitation into two frequency bands using a variable cutoff frequency. The lower band is responsible for representing the voiced parts of speech, whilst the upper band represents unvoiced speech. In doing so the coder's performance during both mixed voicing speech and speech containing acoustic noise is greatly improved, producing soft natural sounding speech.

Thus the resulting detectors are not robust and highly depend on the choice of the training examples. We incorporate the prior on natural images by requiring that the separating hyperplane will not only yield a wide margin , but also that the corresponding positive half space will have a low probability to contain natural images (the background).

Experimental data indicate that (I) single neurons in these regions are broadly tuned to parameters of movement; (2) appropriate commands are elaborated by populations of neurons; (3) the coordinated action of neu-rons can be visualized using a neuronal population vector (NPV). However , the NPV provides only a rough estimate of movement parameters (direction, velocity) and may even fail to reflect the parameters of movement when arm posture is changed. We designed a model of the cortical motor command to investigate the relation between the desired direction of the movement, the actual direction of movement and the direction of the NPV in motor cortex. The model is a two-layer self-organizing neural network which combines broadly-tuned (muscular) proprioceptive and (cartesian) visual information to calculate (angular) motor commands for the initial part of the movement of a two-link arm. The network was trained by motor babbling in 5 positions. Simulations showed that (1) the network produced appropriate movement direction over a large part of the workspace; (2) small deviations of the actual trajectory from the desired trajectory existed at the extremities of the workspace; (3) these deviations were accompanied by large deviations of the NPV from both trajectories. These results suggest the NPV does not give a faithful image of cortical processing during arm reaching movements.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  Currently several  grammatical formalisms  converge towards being declarative and towards utilizing  context-free phrase-structure grammar  as a backbone, e.g.  LFG  and  PATR-II .

This is evident most compellingly by the very low recognition rate of all existing face recognition systems when applied to live CCTV camera input. In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework to perform multi-modal (such as variations in viewpoint and illumination) face image super-resolution for recognition in tensor space. Given a single modal low-resolution face image, we benefit from the multiple factor interactions of training tensor, and super-resolve its high-resolution reconstructions across different modalities for face recognition. Instead of performing pixel-domain super-resolution and recognition independently as two separate sequential processes, we integrate the tasks of super-resolution and recognition by directly computing a maximum likelihood identity parameter vector in high-resolution tensor space for recognition. We show results from multi-modal super-resolution and face recognition experiments across different imaging modalities, using low-resolution images as testing inputs and demonstrate improved recognition rates over standard tensorface and eigenface representations.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  In this paper, we address the problem of combining several  language models (LMs)  .

With this simple task and no semantic labels, we learn a powerful visual representation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The representation contains complementary information to that learned from supervised image datasets like ImageNet. Qualitative results show that our method captures information that is temporally varying, such as human pose. When used as pre-training for action recognition , our method gives significant gains over learning without external data on benchmark datasets like UCF101 and HMDB51. To demonstrate its sensitivity to human pose, we show results for pose estimation on the FLIC and MPII datasets that are competitive, or better than approaches using significantly more supervision. Our method can be combined with supervised representations to provide an additional boost in accuracy.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: When classifying high-dimensional sequence data, traditional methods (e.g., HMMs, CRFs) may require large amounts of training data to avoid overfitting. In such cases dimensionality reduction can be employed to find a low-dimensional representation on which classification can be done more efficiently. Existing methods for supervised dimensionality reduction often presume that the data is densely sampled so that a neighborhood graph structure can be formed, or that the data arises from a known distribution. Sufficient dimension reduction techniques aim to find a low dimensional representation such that the remaining degrees of freedom become conditionally independent of the output values. In this paper we develop a novel sequence kernel dimension reduction approach (S-KDR). Our approach does not make strong assumptions on the distribution of the input data. Spatial, temporal and periodic information is combined in a principled manner, and an optimal manifold is learned for the end-task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several tasks involving the discrimination of human gesture and motion categories, as well as on a database of dynamic textures.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: The Rete and Treat algorithms are considered the most efficient implementation techniques for Forward Chaining rule systems. These algorithms support a language of limited expressive power. Assertions are not allowed to contain variables, making universal quantification impossible to express except as a rule. In this paper we show how to support full unification in these algorithms. We also show that: Supporting full unification is costly; Full unification is not used frequently; A combination of compile time and run time checks can determine when full unification is not needed. We present data to show that the cost of supporting full unification can be reduced in proportion to the degree that it isn't employed and that for many practical systems this cost is negligible.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We investigate the  verbal and nonverbal means  for  grounding  , and propose a design for  embodied conversational agents  that relies on both kinds of  signals  to establish  common ground  in  human-computer interaction  .

Most existing ensemble methods obtain diverse individual learners through resampling the instances or features. In this paper, we propose an alternative way for ensemble construction by resampling pairwise constraints that specify whether a pair of instances belongs to the same class or not. Using pairwise constraints for ensemble construction is challenging because it remains unknown how to influence the base classifiers with the sampled pairwise constraints. We solve this problem with a two-step process. First, we transform the original instances into a new data representation using projections learnt from pairwise constraints. Then, we build the base clas-sifiers with the new data representation. We propose two methods for resampling pairwise constraints following the standard Bagging and Boosting algorithms, respectively. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: This paper solves a specialized regression problem to obtain sampling probabilities for records in databases. The goal is to sample a small set of records over which evaluating aggregate queries can be done both efficiently and accurately. We provide a principled and provable solution for this problem; it is parameterless and requires no data insights. Unlike standard regression problems , the loss is inversely proportional to the regressed-to values. Moreover, a cost zero solution always exists and can only be excluded by hard budget constraints. A unique form of reg-ularization is also needed. We provide an efficient and simple regularized Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm along with a theoretical generalization result. Our extensive experimental results significantly improve over both uniform sampling and standard stratified sampling which are de-facto the industry standards.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Traditional linear Fukunaga-Koontz Transform (FKT) [1] is a powerful discriminative subspaces building approach.

With  WordNet , it is easy to retrieve sets of  semantically related words , a facility that will be used for  sense resolution  during  text processing , as follows. When a  word  with multiple  senses  is encountered, one of two procedures will be followed. Either, (1)  words  related in  meaning  to the  alternative senses  of the  polysemous word  will be retrieved; new  strings  will be derived by substituting these related  words  into the  context  of the  polysemous word ; a large  textual corpus  will then be searched for these  derived strings ; and that  sense  will be chosen that corresponds to the  derived string  that is found most often in the  corpus . Or, (2) the  context  of the  polysemous word  will be used as a key to search a large  corpus ; all  words  found to occur in that  context  will be noted;  WordNet  will then be used to estimate the  semantic distance  from those  words  to the  alternative senses  of the  polysemous word ; and that  sense  will be chosen that is closest in  meaning  to other  words  occurring in the same  context  If successful, this procedure could have practical applications to problems of  information retrieval ,  mechanical translation ,  intelligent tutoring systems , and elsewhere. \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  An extension to the  GPSG grammatical formalism  is proposed, allowing  non-terminals  to consist of finite sequences of  category labels , and allowing  schematic variables  to range over such sequences.

We have previously introduced a statistical model describing the generating process of speech F0 contours, based on the discrete-time version of the Fujisaki model. One remarkable feature of this model is that it has allowed us to derive an efficient algorithm based on powerful statistical methods for estimating the Fujisaki-model parameters from raw F0 contours. To associate a sequence of the Fujisaki-model parameters with a text input based on statistical learning, this paper proposes extending this model to a context-dependent one.

Ant-Q algorithms were inspired by work on the ant system (AS), a distributed algorithm for combinatorial optimization based on the metaphor of ant colonies which was recently proposed in (Dorigo, 1992; Dorigo, Maniezzo and Colorni, 1996). We show that AS is a particular instance of the Ant-Q family, and that there are instances of this family which perform better than AS. We experimentally investigate the functioning of Ant-Q and we show that the results obtained by Ant-Q on symmetric TSP's are competitive with those obtained by other heuristic approaches based on neural networks or local search. Finally, we apply Ant-Q to some difficult asymmetric TSP's obtaining very good results: Ant-Q was able to find solutions of a quality which usually can be found only by very specialized algorithms.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:   Oral communication  is ubiquitous and carries important information yet it is also time consuming to document. Given the development of  storage media and networks  one could just record and store a  conversation  for documentation. The question is, however, how an interesting information piece would be found in a  large database  . Traditional  information retrieval techniques  use a  histogram  of  keywords  as the  document representation  but  oral communication  may offer additional  indices  such as the time and place of the rejoinder and the attendance. An alternative  index  could be the activity such as discussing, planning, informing, story-telling, etc. This paper addresses the problem of the  automatic detection  of those activities in meeting situation and everyday rejoinders. Several extensions of this basic idea are being discussed and/or evaluated: Similar to activities one can define subsets of larger  database  and detect those automatically which is shown on a large  database  of  TV shows  .  Emotions  and other  indices  such as the  dominance distribution of speakers  might be available on the  surface  and could be used directly.

The visual hull sampling process attempts to intersect an object's projection cone with the cones of minimal subsets of other similar objects among those pictured from certain vantage points. We show that our method is able to produce convincing per-object 3D reconstructions on one of the most challenging existing object-category detection datasets, PASCAL VOC.

However, acquiring the necessary training data is typically a tedious and time consuming task that involves manual interaction, active sensing devices and/or synthetic scenes. To overcome this problem, we propose a new, flexible , and scalable way for generating training data that only requires a set of stereo images as input. The key idea of our approach is to use different view points for reasoning about contradictions and consistencies between multiple depth maps generated with the same stereo algorithm. This enables us to generate a huge amount of training data in a fully automated manner. Among other experiments, we demonstrate the potential of our approach by boosting the performance of three learned confidence measures on the KITTI2012 dataset by simply training them on a vast amount of automatically generated training data rather than a limited amount of laser ground truth data.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  Existing techniques extract  term candidates  by looking for  internal and contextual information  associated with  domain specific terms . The algorithms always face the dilemma that fewer  features  are not enough to distinguish  terms  from  non-terms  whereas more  features  lead to more conflicts among selected  features . This paper presents a novel approach for  term extraction  based on  delimiters  which are much more stable and domain independent. The proposed approach is not as sensitive to  term frequency  as that of previous works. This approach has no strict limit or  hard rules  and thus they can deal with all kinds of  terms . It also requires no prior  domain knowledge  and no additional  training  to adapt to new  domains . Consequently, the proposed approach can be applied to different  domains  easily and it is especially useful for  resource-limited domains .

Experiments on  new term extraction  indicate that the proposed approach can also serve as an effective tool for  domain lexicon expansion . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We propose a draft scheme of the  model  formalizing the  structure of communicative context  in  dialogue interaction .

Furthermore, we show how the recently developed efficient subwindow search (ESS) procedure [11] can be integrated into the last stage of our method. This allows us to use our method to act not only as a faster procedure for cascade evaluation, but also as a tool to perform efficient branch-and-bound object detection with nonlinear quality functions, in particular kernel-ized support vector machines.

Inference in these models involves solving a combinatorial optimization problem, with methods such as graph cuts, belief propagation. Although several methods have been proposed to learn the model parameters from training data, they suffer from various drawbacks. Learning these parameters involves computing the partition function, which is intractable. To overcome this, state-of-the-art structured learning methods frame the problem as one of large margin estimation. Iterative solutions have been proposed to solve the resulting convex optimization problem. Each iteration involves solving an inference problem over all the labels , which limits the efficiency of these structured methods. In this paper we present an efficient large margin piece-wise learning method which is widely applicable. We show how the resulting optimization problem can be reduced to an equivalent convex problem with a small number of constraints , and solve it using an efficient scheme. Our method is both memory and computationally efficient.

An experimental system embodying this mechanism has been implemented for processing  definitions  from the  Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English .

The structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the  classification  of new  word senses  in terms of the  senses  of  words  in the  restricted vocabulary . Examples illustrating the output generated are presented, and some qualitative performance results and problems that were encountered are discussed. The analysis process applies successively more specific  phrasal analysis rules  as determined by a hierarchy of  patterns  in which less specific  patterns  dominate more specific ones. This ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the  definitions  are produced when more complete analyses are not possible, resulting in a relatively robust  analysis mechanism .

Spontaneous speech understanding is combined with the video-based recognition of natural gestures. One of the major scientific goals of SmartKom is to design new computational methods for the seamless integration and mutual disambiguation of multimodal input and output on a semantic and pragmatic level. SmartKom is based on the situated delegation-oriented dialog paradigm, in which the user delegates a task to a virtual communication assistant, visualized as a lifelike character on a graphical display.

Our system is suitable for embedded computer vision application based on three reasons. Firstly, the system was based on a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier where classification progress can be implemented easily and quickly in embedded hardware. Secondly , we use compacted motion features easily obtained from videos. We address the limitations of the well known Motion History Image (MHI) and propose a new Hierarchical Motion History Histogram (HMHH) feature to represent the motion information. HMHH not only provides rich motion information, but also remains computationally inexpensive. Finally, we combine MHI and HMHH together and extract a low dimension feature vector to be used in the SVM classifiers.

It is based on the  theory of tenses  of H. Kamp and Ch. Rohrer. Instead of using  operators  to express the  meaning  of the  tenses  the Reichenbachian point of view is adopted and refined such that the impact of the  tenses  with respect to the  meaning  of the  text  is understood as contribution to the integration of the  events  of a  sentence  in the  event structure  of the preceeding  text . Thereby a  system of relevant times  provided by the preceeding  text  and by the  temporal adverbials  of the  sentence  being processed is used. This system consists of one or more  reference times  and  temporal perspective times , the  speech time  and the  location time . The special interest of our proposal is to establish a plausible choice of anchors for the  new event  out of the  system of relevant times  and to update this  system of temporal coordinates  correctly. The problem of choice is largely neglected in the literature. In opposition to the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the exact  meaning  of the  tenses  is fixed by the  resolution component  and not in the process of  syntactic analysis . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  The reality of  analogies between words  is refuted by noone (e.g., I walked is to to walk as I laughed is to to laugh, noted I walked : to walk :: I laughed : to laugh).

This is an extremely challenging task because (i) visual comparisons not only need to be fine-grained but also executed cross-domain, (ii) free-hand (finger) sketches are highly abstract, making fine-grained matching harder, and most importantly (iii) annotated cross-domain sketch-photo datasets required for training are scarce, challenging many state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. In this paper, for the first time, we address all these challenges, providing a step towards the capabilities that would underpin a commercial sketch-based image retrieval application. We introduce a new database of 1,432 sketch-photo pairs from two categories with 32,000 fine-grained triplet ranking annotations. We then develop a deep triplet-ranking model for instance-level SBIR with a novel data augmentation and staged pre-training strategy to alleviate the issue of insufficient fine-grained training data.

For this purpose, a flow field generated by a moving crowd is treated as an aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is overlaid on the flow field, and is advected using a numerical integration scheme. The evolution of particles through the flow is tracked using a Flow Map, whose spatial gradients are subsequently used to setup a Cauchy Green Deformation tensor for quantifying the amount by which the neighboring particles have diverged over the length of the integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is used to construct a Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) field, which reveals the Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow. The LCS divide flow into regions of qualitatively different dynamics and are used to locate boundaries of the flow segments in a normalized cuts framework. Any change in the number of flow segments over time is regarded as an instability, which is detected by establishing correspondences between flow segments over time. The experiments are conducted on a challenging set of videos taken from Google Video and a National Geographic documentary.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  In order to build robust  automatic abstracting systems , there is a need for better  training resources  than are currently available.

In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach to construct a joint filter based on Convolution-al Neural Networks. In contrast to existing methods that consider only the guidance image, our method can selectively transfer salient structures that are consistent in both guidance and target images. We show that the model trained on a certain type of data, e.g., RGB and depth images, generalizes well for other modalities, e.g., Flash/Non-Flash and RGB/NIR images.

Using our approach we are able to intelligently segment scenes with objects of greater complexity than previous physics-based segmentation algorithms.

This is achieved by solving a static Schrödinger equation instead of the corresponding static Hamilton-Jacobi equation in this setting. The SDT representation is an analytic expression and following the theoretical physics literature, can be normalized to have unit L2 norm-making it a square-root density, which is identified with a point on a unit Hilbert sphere, whose intrinsic geometry is fully known. The Fisher-Rao metric, a natural metric for the space of densities leads to analytic expressions for the geodesic distance between points on this sphere. In this paper, we use the well known Riemannian framework never before used for point cloud matching, and present a novel matching algorithm. We pose point set matching under rigid and non-rigid transformations in this framework and solve for the transformations using standard nonlinear optimization techniques. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our algorithm-dubbed SDTM-we present several synthetic and real data examples along with extensive comparisons to state-of-the-art techniques.

SVC makes it possible to convert singing voice characteristics of an arbitrary source singer into those of an arbitrary target singer. However, speech quality of the converted singing voice is significantly degraded compared to that of a natural singing voice due to various factors, such as analysis and modeling errors in the vocoder-based framework. To alleviate this degradation, we propose a statistical conversion process that directly modifies the signal in the waveform domain by estimating the difference in the spectra of the source and target singers' singing voices. The differential spectral feature is directly estimated using a differential Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that is analytically derived from the traditional GMM used as a conversion model in the conventional SVC. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method makes it possible to significantly improve speech quality in the converted singing voice while preserving the conversion accuracy of singer identity compared to the conventional SVC.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:    We introduce a new  interactive corpus exploration tool  called  InfoMagnets  .

To this end, we propose to efficiently locate object regions according to pixelwise object probability, rather than measuring the objectness from a set of sampled windows. We formulate the proposal generation problem as a generative proba-bilistic model such that object proposals of different shapes (i.e., sizes and orientations) can be produced by locating the local maximum likelihoods. The new approach has three main advantages. First, it helps the object detector handle objects of different orientations. Second, as the shapes of the proposals may vary to fit the objects, the resulting proposals are tighter than the sampling windows with fixed sizes. Third, it avoids massive window sampling, and thereby reducing the number of proposals while maintaining a high recall. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset show that the proposed OOP outperforms the state-of-the-art fast methods. Further experiments show that the rotation invariant property helps a class-specific object detector achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art proposal generation methods in either object rotation scenarios or general scenarios. Generating OOPs is very fast and takes only 0.5s per image.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:    This paper proposes a series of modifications to the  left corner parsing algorithm  for  context-free grammars  .

Unlike other techniques that handle large outlier percentages, MINPRAN does not rely on a known error bound for the good data. Instead it assumes that the bad data are randomly (uniformly) distributed within the dynamic range of the sensor. Based on this, MINPRAN uses random sampling to search for the t and the number of inliers to the t that are least likely to have occurred randomly. It runs in time O(N 2 + SN log N), where S is the number of random samples and N is the number of data points. We demonstrate analytically that MINPRAN distinguishes good ts from ts to random data, and that MINPRAN nds accurate ts and nearly the correct number of inliers, regardless of the percentage of true inliers.

Locally, a video frame is visually and semantically similar with its adjacent frames. Holistically, a video has its inherent structure—the correlations among video frames. For example, even the frames far from each other may also hold similar semantics. Such context information is therefore important to characterize the intrinsic representation of a video frame. In this paper, we present a novel approach to learn the deep video representation by exploring both local and holistic contexts. Specifically, we propose a triplet sampling mechanism to encode the local temporal relationship of adjacent frames based on their deep representations. In addition, we incorporate the graph structure of the video, as a priori, to holistically preserve the inherent correlations among video frames. Our approach is fully unsupervised and trained in an end-to-end deep convolutional neu-ral network architecture. By extensive experiments, we show that our learned representation can significantly boost several video recognition tasks (retrieval , classification, and highlight detection) over traditional video representations.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We argue in favor of the the use of  labeled directed graph  to represent various types of  linguistic structures , and illustrate how this allows one to view  NLP tasks  as  graph transformations .

For example, nucleotides in a DNA sequence, children's names in a given state and year, and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomial distributions. In all of these cases, we expect some form of dependency between the draws: the nucleotide at one position in the DNA strand may depend on the preceding nucleotides, children's names are highly correlated from year to year, and topics in text may be correlated and dynamic. These dependencies are not naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation. Here, we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in Pólya-gamma augmentation to reformu-late the multinomial distribution in terms of latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods, enabling us to take advantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models with minimal overhead.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  The  interlingual approach to MT  has been repeatedly advocated by researchers originally interested in  natural language understanding  who take  machine translation  to be one possible application.

These changes made the challenge more readily accessible, especially to participants from outside the audio processing field. Compared to the 2012 SRE, the i-vector challenge saw an increase in the number of participants by nearly a factor of two, and a two orders of magnitude increase in the number of systems submitted for evaluation.

Previous approaches detect and describe features at different scale levels by building or approximating the Gaussian scale space of an image. However, Gaussian blurring does not respect the natural boundaries of objects and smoothes to the same degree both details and noise, reducing localization accuracy and distinctiveness. In contrast, we detect and describe 2D features in a nonlinear scale space by means of nonlinear diffusion filtering. In this way, we can make blurring locally adaptive to the image data, reducing noise but retaining object boundaries, obtaining superior localization accuracy and distinctiviness. The nonlinear scale space is built using efficient Additive Operator Splitting (AOS) techniques and variable con-ductance diffusion. We present an extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets and a practical matching application on deformable surfaces. Even though our features are somewhat more expensive to compute than SURF due to the construction of the nonlinear scale space, but comparable to SIFT, our results reveal a step forward in performance both in detection and description against previous state-of-the-art methods.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: A recognition scheme that scales efficiently to a large number of objects is presented. The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD's. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  In this paper, we describe a  phrase-based unigram model  for  statistical machine translation  that uses a much simpler set of  model parameters  than similar  phrase-based models  .

It concerns a process of automatically labeling the image contents with a pre-defined set of keywords which are exploited to represent the image semantics. A Maximum Entropy Model-based approach to the task of automatic image annotation is proposed in this paper. In the phase of training, a basic visual vocabulary consisting of blob-tokens to describe the image content is generated at first; then the statistical relationship is modeled between the blob-tokens and keywords by a Maximum Entropy Model constructed from the training set of labeled images. In the phase of annotation, for an unlabeled image, the most likely associated keywords are predicted in terms of the blob-token set extracted from the given image.

Functional objects do not have discriminative appearance and shape, but they affect behavior of people in the scene. For example, they \" attract \" people to approach them for satisfying certain needs (e.g., vending machines could quench thirst), or \" repel \" people to avoid them (e.g., grass lawns). Therefore, functional objects can be viewed as \" dark matter \" , emanating \" dark energy \" that affects people's trajectories in the video. To detect \" dark matter \" and infer their \" dark energy \" field, we extend the La-grangian mechanics. People are treated as particle-agents with latent intents to approach \" dark matter \" and thus satisfy their needs, where their motions are subject to a composite \" dark energy \" field of all functional objects in the scene. We make the assumption that people take globally optimal paths toward the intended \" dark matter \" while avoiding latent obstacles. A Bayesian framework is used to probabilistically model: people's trajectories and intents, constraint map of the scene, and locations of functional objects. A data-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process is used for inference. Our evaluation on videos of public squares and courtyards demonstrates our effectiveness in localizing functional objects and predicting people's trajectories in unobserved parts of the video footage.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: In spite of over two decades of intense research, illumination and pose invariance remain prohibitively challenging aspects of face recognition for most practical applications. The objective of this work is to recognize faces using video sequences both for training and recognition input, in a realistic, unconstrained setup in which lighting, pose and user motion pattern have a wide variability and face images are of low resolution. In particular there are three areas of novelty: (i) we show how a photometric model of image formation can be combined with a statistical model of generic face appearance variation, learnt offline, to generalize in the presence of extreme illumination changes; (ii) we use the smoothness of geodesically local appearance manifold structure and a robust same-identity likelihood to achieve invariance to unseen head poses; and (iii) we introduce an accurate video sequence \" reillumination \" algorithm to achieve robustness to face motion patterns in video. We describe a fully automatic recognition system based on the proposed method and an extensive evaluation on 171 individuals and over 1300 video sequences with extreme illumination, pose and head motion variation.

At the same time, the recent improvements in the  BLEU scores  of  statistical machine translation (SMT)  suggests that  SMT models  are good at predicting the right  translation  of the  words  in  source language sentences  . Surprisingly however, the  WSD   accuracy  of  SMT models  has never been evaluated and compared with that of the dedicated  WSD models  . We present controlled experiments showing the  WSD   accuracy  of current typical  SMT models  to be significantly lower than that of all the dedicated  WSD models  considered. This tends to support the view that despite recent speculative claims to the contrary, current  SMT models  do have limitations in comparison with dedicated  WSD models  , and that  SMT  should benefit from the better predictions made by the  WSD models  . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:    It is well-known that there are  polysemous words  like  sentence  whose  meaning  or  sense  depends on the context of use. We have recently reported on two new  word-sense disambiguation systems  , one trained on  bilingual material  (the  Canadian Hansards  ) and the other trained on  monolingual material  (  Roget's Thesaurus  and  Grolier's Encyclopedia  ). As this work was nearing completion, we observed a very strong  discourse  effect. That is, if a  polysemous word  such as  sentence  appears two or more times in a  well-written discourse  , it is extremely likely that they will all share the same  sense  . This paper describes an experiment which confirmed this hypothesis and found that the tendency to share  sense  in the same  discourse  is extremely strong (98%). This result can be used as an additional source of  constraint  for improving the performance of the  word-sense disambiguation algorithm  . In addition, it could also be used to help evaluate  disambiguation algorithms  that did not make use of the  discourse constraint  . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Boosting methods are known not to usually overfit training data even as the size of the generated classifiers becomes large. Schapire et al. attempted to explain this phenomenon in terms of the margins the classifier achieves on training examples. Later, however, Breiman cast serious doubt on this explanation by introducing a boosting algorithm, arc-gv, that can generate a higher margins distribution than AdaBoost and yet performs worse. In this paper, we take a close look at Breiman's compelling but puzzling results. Although we can reproduce his main finding, we find that the poorer performance of arc-gv can be explained by the increased complexity of the base classifiers it uses, an explanation supported by our experiments and entirely consistent with the margins theory. Thus, we find maximizing the margins is desirable, but not necessarily at the expense of other factors, especially base-classifier complexity.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We present an application of  ambiguity packing and stochastic disambiguation techniques  for  Lexical-Functional Grammars (LFG)  to the domain of  sentence condensation  .

We show that a set of different homographies can be embedded in different ways to a higher-dimensional real or complex space, so that each homography corresponds to either a complex bilinear form or a real quadratic form. Each embedding reveals different algebraic properties and relations of homo-graphies. We give a closed-form segmentation solution for each case by utilizing these properties based on subspace-segmentation methods. These theoretical results show that one can intrinsically segment a piece-wise planar scene from 2-D images without explicitly performing any 3-D reconstruction. The resulting segmentation may make subsequent 3-D reconstruction much better-conditioned. We demonstrate the proposed methods with some convincing experimental results.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  In this paper we compare two competing approaches to  part-of-speech tagging ,  statistical and constraint-based disambiguation , using  French  as our  test language .

The desired patches need to satisfy two requirements: 1) to be representative, they need to occur frequently enough in the visual world; 2) to be discriminative, they need to be different enough from the rest of the visual world. The patches could correspond to parts, objects, \" visual phrases \" , etc. but are not restricted to be any one of them. We pose this as an unsupervised discriminative clustering problem on a huge dataset of image patches. We use an iterative procedure which alternates between clustering and training discriminative classifiers, while applying careful cross-validation at each step to prevent overfitting. The paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of discriminative patches as an unsupervised mid-level visual representation, suggesting that it could be used in place of visual words for many tasks. Furthermore, discrim-inative patches can also be used in a supervised regime, such as scene classification, where they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Indoor-67 dataset.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Light fields are image-based representations that use densely sampled rays as a scene description. In this paper, we explore geometric structures of 3D lines in ray space for improving light field triangulation and stereo matching. The triangulation problem aims to fill in the ray space with continuous and non-overlapping simplices anchored at sampled points (rays). Such a triangulation provides a piecewise-linear interpolant useful for light field super-resolution. We show that the light field space is largely bi-linear due to 3D line segments in the scene, and direct tri-angulation of these bilinear subspaces leads to large errors. We instead present a simple but effective algorithm to first map bilinear subspaces to line constraints and then apply Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT). Based on our analysis, we further develop a novel line-assisted graph-cut (LAGC) algorithm that effectively encodes 3D line constraints into light field stereo matching. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that both our triangulation and LAGC algorithms outperform state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy and visual quality.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We propose a method of organizing reading materials for  vocabulary learning .

After registration, these watertight models with different poses are used to train a parametric model in a fashion similar to the SCAPE method. Once the parametric model is built, it can be used as an anim-itable avatar or more interestingly synthesizing dynamic 3D models from single-view depth videos.

Instead of representing scene/object by a collection of isolated 3D features (usually points), our algorithm uses a surface controlled by a small set of parameters. Compared with previous model-based approaches, our approach has the following advantages. First, instead of using the model space as a regular-izer, we directly use it as our search space, thus resulting in a more elegant formulation with fewer unknowns and fewer equations. Second, our algorithm automatically associates tracked points with their correct locations on the surfaces, thereby eliminating the need for a prior 2D-to-3D association. Third, regarding face modeling, we use a very small set of face metrics (meaningful deformations) to parame-terize the face geometry, resulting in a smaller search space and a better posed system. Experiments with both synthetic and real data show that this new algorithm is faster, more accurate and more stable than existing ones.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Image matching is a fundamental problem in Computer Vision. In the context of feature-based matching, SIFT and its variants have long excelled in a wide array of applications. However, for ultra-wide baselines, as in the case of aerial images captured under large camera rotations, the appearance variation goes beyond the reach of SIFT and RANSAC. In this paper we propose a data-driven, deep learning-based approach that sidesteps local correspondence by framing the problem as a classification task. Furthermore , we demonstrate that local correspondences can still be useful. To do so we incorporate an attention mechanism to produce a set of probable matches, which allows us to further increase performance. We train our models on a dataset of urban aerial imagery consisting of 'same' and 'different' pairs, collected for this purpose, and characterize the problem via a human study with annotations from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We demonstrate that our models outperform the state-of-the-art on ultra-wide baseline matching and approach human accuracy.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: In this paper, we develop a geometric framework for linear or nonlinear discriminant subspace learning and classification. In our framework, the structures of classes are conceptualized as a semi-Riemannian manifold which is considered as a submanifold embedded in an ambient semi-Riemannian space. The class structures of original samples can be characterized and deformed by local metrics of the semi-Riemannian space. Semi-Riemannian metrics are uniquely determined by the smoothing of discrete functions and the nullity of the semi-Riemannian space. Based on the geometrization of class structures, optimizing class structures in the feature space is equivalent to maximizing the quadratic quantities of metric tensors in the semi-Riemannian space. Thus supervised discriminant subspace learning reduces to unsupervised semi-Riemannian mani-fold learning. Based on the proposed framework, a novel algorithm, dubbed as Semi-Riemannian Discriminant Analysis (SRDA), is presented for subspace-based classification. The performance of SRDA is tested on face recognition (singular case) and handwritten capital letter classification (nonsingular case) against existing algorithms. The experimental results show that SRDA works well on recognition and classification, implying that semi-Riemannian geometry is a promising new tool for pattern recognition and machine learning.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  Towards deep analysis of  compositional classes of paraphrases , we have examined a  class-oriented framework  for collecting  paraphrase examples , in which  sentential paraphrases  are collected for each  paraphrase class  separately by means of  automatic candidate generation  and  manual judgement .

In this paper, for the first time, we propose to use a Neural Network classifier furnished by an SAE structure for detecting the errors made by a strong Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. Error detection on an automatic transcription provided by a \" strong \" ASR system, i.e. exhibiting a small word error rate, is difficult due to the limited number of \" positive \" examples (i.e. words erroneously recognized) available for training a binary classi-fier. In this paper we investigate and compare different types of classifiers for automatically detecting ASR errors, including the one based on a stacked auto-encoder architecture. We show the effectiveness of the latter by measuring and comparing performance on the automatic transcriptions of an English corpus collected from TED talks. Performance of each investigated classifier is evaluated both via receiving operating curve and via a measure, called mean absolute error, related to the quality in predicting the corresponding word error rate. The results demonstrates that the classifier based on SAE detects the ASR errors better than the other classification methods.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Reflections in image sequences consist of several layers superimposed over each other.

It arises whenever objects are not labeled with unique identifiers or when those identifiers may not be perceived perfectly. In such cases, two observations may or may not correspond to the same object. In this paper, we consider the problem in the context of citation matching—the problem of deciding which citations correspond to the same publication. Our approach is based on the use of a relational probability model to define a generative model for the domain, including models of author and title corruption and a probabilistic citation grammar. Identity uncertainty is handled by extending standard models to incorporate probabilities over the possible mappings between terms in the language and objects in the domain. Inference is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, augmented with specific methods for generating efficient proposals when the domain contains many objects. Results on several citation data sets show that the method outperforms current algorithms for citation matching. The declarative, relational nature of the model also means that our algorithm can determine object characteristics such as author names by combining multiple citations of multiple papers.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  This paper shows that it is very often possible to identify the  source language  of medium-length speeches in the  EUROPARL corpus  on the basis of  frequency counts  of  word n-grams  (87.2%-96.7%  accuracy  depending on  classification method ).

HFOs additionally serve as a prototypical example of challenges in the analysis of discrete events in high-temporal resolution, intracranial EEG data. Two primary challenges are 1) dimensionality reduction, and 2) assessing feasibility of classification. Dimensionality reduction assumes that the data lie on a manifold with dimension less than that of the features space. However, previous HFO analysis have assumed a linear manifold, global across time, space (i.e. recording electrode/channel), and individual patients. Instead, we assess both a) whether linear methods are appropriate and b) the consistency of the manifold across time, space, and patients. We also estimate bounds on the Bayes classification error to quantify the distinction between two classes of HFOs (those occurring during seizures and those occurring due to other processes). This analysis provides the foundation for future clinical use of HFO features and guides the analysis for other discrete events, such as individual action potentials or multi-unit activity.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  Two themes have evolved in  speech and text image processing  work at  Xerox PARC  that expand and redefine the role of  recognition technology  in  document-oriented applications .

In this work, we focus on the problem of non-rigid image registration. A number of powerful registration criteria have been developed in the last decade, most prominently the criterion of maximum mutual information. Although this criterion provides for good registration results in many applications, it remains a purely low-level criterion. As a consequence, registration results will deteriorate once this low-level information is corrupted, due to noise, partial occlusions or missing image structure. In this paper , we will develop a Bayesian framework that allows to impose statistically learned prior knowledge about the joint intensity distribution into image registration methods. The prior is given by a kernel density estimate on the space of joint intensity distributions computed from a representative set of pre-registered image pairs. This nonparametric prior accurately models previously learned intensity relations between various image modalities and slice locations. Experimental results demonstrate that the resulting registration process is more robust to missing low-level information as it favors intensity correspondences statistically consistent with the learned intensity distributions.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  In this paper I will argue for a  model of grammatical processing  that is based on  uniform processing  and  knowledge sources .

We consider the problem of approximate joint matrix triangularization when the matrices in M are jointly diagonalizable and real, but we only observe a set M' of noise perturbed versions of the matrices in M. Our main result is a first-order upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of the matrices in M' and any exact joint triangularizer of the matrices in M. The bound depends only on the observable matrices in M' and the noise level. In particular, it does not depend on optimization specific properties of the triangularizer, such as its proximity to critical points, that are typical of existing bounds in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first a posteriori bound for joint matrix decomposition.

Traditional methods for color constancy can improve surface re-flectance estimates from such uncalibrated images, but their output depends significantly on the background scene. In many recognition and retrieval applications, we have access to image sets that contain multiple views of the same object in different environments; we show in this paper that correspondences between these images provide important constraints that can improve color constancy. We introduce the multi-view color constancy problem, and present a method to recover estimates of underlying surface re-flectance based on joint estimation of these surface properties and the illuminants present in multiple images. The method can exploit image correspondences obtained by various alignment techniques, and we show examples based on matching local region features.

Special-purpose constraint propagation algorithms frequently make implicit use of short supports — by examining a subset of the variables, they can infer support (a justification that a variable-value pair still forms part of a solution to the constraint) for all other variables and values and save substantial work. Recently short supports have been used in general purpose prop-agators, and (when the constraint is amenable to short supports) speed ups of more than three orders of magnitude have been demonstrated. In this paper we present SHORTSTR2, a development of the Simple Tabular Reduction algorithm STR2+. We show that SHORTSTR2 is complementary to the existing algorithms SHORTGAC and HAGGISGAC that exploit short supports, while being much simpler. When a constraint is amenable to short supports, the short support set can be exponentially smaller than the full-length support set. Therefore SHORTSTR2 can efficiently propagate many constraints that STR2+ cannot even load into memory. We also show that SHORTSTR2 can be combined with a simple algorithm to identify short supports from full-length supports, to provide a superior drop-in replacement for STR2+.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Video provides not only rich visual cues such as motion and appearance, but also much less explored long-range temporal interactions among objects.

Second, we devise a new track clustering cost function that includes occlusion reasoning, in the form of depth ordering constraints, as well as motion similarity along the tracks.

In contrast to other works that address this problem using multiple classifiers, each one specialized for a specific orientation, we propose a simple two-step approach with an estimation stage and a classification stage. The estimator yields an initial set of potential object poses that are then validated by the classifier. This methodology allows reducing the time complexity of the algorithm while classification results remain high. The classifier we use in both stages is based on a boosted combination of Random Ferns over local histograms of oriented gradients (HOGs), which we compute during a pre-processing step. Both the use of supervised learning and working on the gradient space makes our approach robust while being efficient at run-time. We show these properties by thorough testing on standard databases and on a new database made of motorbikes under planar rotations, and with challenging conditions such as cluttered backgrounds, changing illumination conditions and partial occlusions.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  This paper presents a new approach to  statistical sentence generation  in which alternative  phrases  are represented as packed sets of  trees , or  forests , and then ranked statistically to choose the best one.

This paper explores the role of  user modeling  in such  systems  . It begins with a characterization of what a  user model  is and how it can be used. The types of information that a  user model  may be required to keep about a  user  are then identified and discussed.  User models  themselves can vary greatly depending on the requirements of the situation and the implementation, so several dimensions along which they can be classified are presented. Since acquiring the knowledge for a  user model  is a fundamental problem in  user modeling  , a section is devoted to this topic. Next, the benefits and costs of implementing a  user modeling component  for a system are weighed in light of several aspects of the  interaction requirements  that may be imposed by the system. Finally, the current state of research in  user modeling  is summarized, and future research topics that must be addressed in order to achieve powerful, general  user modeling systems  are assessed. \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We propose a method that automatically generates  paraphrase  sets from  seed sentences  to be used as  reference sets  in objective  machine translation evaluation measures  like  BLEU  and  NIST  .

An objective function is defined to impose lo-calization constraint, in addition to the non-negativity constraint in the standard NMF [1]. This gives a set of bases which not only allows a non-subtractive (part-based) representation of images but also manifests localized features.

To advance research on animated GIF understanding, we collected a new dataset, Tumblr GIF (TGIF), with 100K animated GIFs from Tumblr and 120K natural language descriptions obtained via crowdsourcing. The motivation for this work is to develop a testbed for image sequence description systems, where the task is to generate natural language descriptions for animated GIFs or video clips. To ensure a high quality dataset, we developed a series of novel quality controls to validate free-form text input from crowd-workers. We show that there is unambiguous association between visual content and natural language descriptions in our dataset, making it an ideal benchmark for the visual content captioning task. We perform extensive statistical analyses to compare our dataset to existing image and video description datasets. Next, we provide baseline results on the animated GIF description task, using three representative techniques: nearest neighbor, statistical machine translation , and recurrent neural networks. Finally, we show that models fine-tuned from our animated GIF description dataset can be helpful for automatic movie description.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We present a novel approach for automatically acquiring  English topic signatures .

This process enables the system to understand  user utterances  based on the  context  of a  dialogue  .

With the rise of deep archi-tectures, the prime focus has been on object category recognition. Deep learning methods have achieved wide success in this task. In contrast, object pose estimation using these approaches has received relatively less attention. In this work, we study how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures can be adapted to the task of simultaneous object recognition and pose estimation. We investigate and analyze the layers of various CNN models and extensively compare between them with the goal of discovering how the layers of distributed representations within CNNs represent object pose information and how this contradicts with object category representations.

We introduce the concept of intrinsic textures, which are pixel-resolution surface textures representing the intrinsic appearance parameters of a scene. Unlike previous video relighting methods, the approach does not assume regions of uniform albedo, which makes it applicable to richly textured scenes. We show that intrinsic image methods can be used to refine an initial, low-frequency shading estimate based on a global lighting reconstruction from an original texture and coarse scene geometry in order to resolve the inherent global ambiguity in shading. The method is applied to relight-ing of free-viewpoint rendering from multiple view video capture. This demonstrates relighting with reproduction of fine surface detail. \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  Recent years have seen increasing research on extracting and using temporal information in  natural language applications .

The base  parser  produces a set of  candidate parses  for each input  sentence  , with associated  probabilities  that define an initial  ranking  of these  parses  . A second  model  then attempts to improve upon this initial  ranking  , using additional  features  of the  tree  as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a  tree  to be represented as an arbitrary set of  features  , without concerns about how these  features  interact or overlap and without the need to define a  derivation  or a  generative model  which takes these  features  into account . We introduce a new method for the  reranking task  , based on the  boosting approach  to  ranking problems  described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the  boosting method  to  parsing  the  Wall Street Journal treebank  . The method combined the  log-likelihood  under a  baseline model  (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000  features  over  parse trees  that were not included in the original  model  . The new  model  achieved 89.75%  F-measure  , a 13% relative decrease in  F-measure  error over the  baseline model's score  of 88.2%. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the  boosting approach  which takes advantage of the  sparsity of the feature space  in the  parsing data  . Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious  implementation  of the  boosting approach  . We argue that the method is an appealing alternative - in terms of both simplicity and efficiency - to work on  feature selection methods  within  log-linear (maximum-entropy) models  .

First, images are partitioned into regions using one-class classification and patch-based clustering algorithms where one-class classifiers model the regions with relatively uniform color and texture properties, and clustering of patches aims to detect structures in the remaining regions. Next, the resulting regions are clustered to obtain a codebook of region types, and two models are constructed for scene representation: a \" bag of individual regions \" representation where each region is regarded separately , and a \" bag of region pairs \" representation where regions with particular spatial relationships are considered together. Given these representations, scene classification is done using Bayesian classifiers. We also propose a novel region selection algorithm that identifies region types that are frequently found in a particular class of scenes but rarely exist in other classes, and also consistently occur together in the same class of scenes. Experiments on the LabelMe data set showed that the proposed models significantly out-perform a baseline global feature-based approach.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  A  flexible parser  can deal with input that deviates from its  grammar , in addition to input that conforms to it. Ideally, such a  parser  will correct the deviant input: sometimes, it will be unable to correct it at all; at other times,  correction  will be possible, but only to within a range of ambiguous possibilities. This paper is concerned with such ambiguous situations, and with making it as easy as possible for the  ambiguity  to be resolved through consultation with the user of the  parser  - we presume interactive use. We show the importance of asking the user for clarification in as focused a way as possible.  Focused interaction  of this kind is facilitated by a  construction-specific approach  to  flexible parsing , with  specialized parsing techniques  for each type of  construction , and specialized  ambiguity representations  for each type of  ambiguity  that a particular  construction  can give rise to. A  construction-specific approach  also aids in  task-specific language development  by allowing a  language definition  that is natural in terms of the  task domain  to be interpreted directly without compilation into a  uniform grammar formalism , thus greatly speeding the  testing  of changes to the  language definition . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  The purpose of this research is to test the efficacy of applying  automated evaluation techniques  , originally devised for the evaluation of  human language learners  , to the  output  of  machine translation (MT) systems  .

Previous change detection methods, focusing on detecting large-scale significant changes, cannot do this well. This paper proposes a feasible end-to-end approach to this challenging problem. We start from active camera relocation that quickly relocates camera to nearly the same pose and position of the last time observation. To guarantee detection sensitivity and accuracy of minute changes, in an observation, we capture a group of images under multiple illuminations, which need only to be roughly aligned to the last time lighting conditions. Given two times observations, we formulate fine-grained change detection as a joint optimization problem of three related factors, i.e., normal-aware lighting difference, camera geometry correction flow, and real scene change mask. We solve the three factors in a coarse-to-fine manner and achieve reliable change decision by rank minimization. We build three real-world datasets to benchmark fine-grained change detection of misaligned scenes under varied multiple lighting conditions. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of our approach over state-of-the-art change detection methods and its ability to distinguish real scene changes from false ones caused by lighting variations.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We present a new HMM tagger that exploits  context  on both sides of a  word  to be tagged, and evaluate it in both the  unsupervised and supervised case .

Our approach is based on the iterative deformation of a 3–D surface mesh to minimize an objective function. We show that combining anisotropic meshing with a non-quadratic approach to regularization enables us to obtain satisfactory reconstruction results using triangulations with few vertices. Structural or numerical constraints can then be added locally to the reconstruction process through a constrained optimization scheme. They improve the reconstruction results and enforce their consistency with a priori knowledge about object shape. The strong description and modeling properties of differential features make them useful tools that can be efficiently used as constraints for 3–D reconstruction .\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  This paper presents an analysis of  temporal anaphora  in  sentences  which contain  quantification over events , within the framework of  Discourse Representation Theory .

Owing to these variations, the pedestrian data is distributed as highly-curved manifolds in the feature space, despite the current convolutional neural networks (CNN)'s capability of feature extraction. However, the distribution is unknown, so it is difficult to use the geodesic distance when comparing two samples. In practice, the current deep embedding methods use the Euclidean distance for the training and test. On the other hand, the manifold learning methods suggest to use the Euclidean distance in the local range, combining with the graphical relationship between samples , for approximating the geodesic distance. From this point of view, selecting suitable positive (i.e. intra-class) training samples within a local range is critical for training the CNN embedding, especially when the data has large intra-class variations. In this paper, we propose a novel moderate positive sample mining method to train robust CNN for person re-identification, dealing with the problem of large variation. In addition, we improve the learning by a metric weight constraint, so that the learned metric has a better generalization ability. Experiments show that these two strategies are effective in learning robust deep metrics for person re-identification, and accordingly our deep model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks of person re-identification. Therefore, the study presented in this paper may be useful in inspiring new designs of deep models for person re-identification.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: This paper presents an algorithm for learning the time-varying shape of a non-rigid 3D object from uncalibrated 2D tracking data. We model shape motion as a rigid component (rotation and translation) combined with a non-rigid deformation. Reconstruction is ill-posed if arbitrary deformations are allowed. We constrain the problem by assuming that the object shape at each time instant is drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Based on this assumption, the algorithm simultaneously estimates 3D shape and motion for each time frame, learns the parameters of the Gaussian, and robustly fills-in missing data points. We then extend the algorithm to model temporal smoothness in object shape, thus allowing it to handle severe cases of missing data.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We present a framework for  word alignment  based on  log-linear models .

As a highly subjective visual attribute, annotating the interesting-ness value of training data for learning a prediction model is challenging. To make the annotation less subjective and more reliable, recent studies employ crowdsourcing tools to collect pairwise comparisons – relying on majority voting to prune the annotation outliers/errors. In this paper, we propose a more principled way to identify annotation outliers by formulating the interestingness prediction task as a unified robust learning to rank problem, tackling both the outlier detection and interestingness prediction tasks jointly. Extensive experiments on both image and video interestingness benchmark datasets demonstrate that our new approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Graph-cuts optimization is prevalent in vision and graphics problems. It is thus of great practical importance to parallelize the graph-cuts optimization using to-day's ubiquitous multi-core machines. However, the current best serial algorithm by Boykov and Kolmogorov [4] (called the BK algorithm) still has the superior empirical performance. It is non-trivial to parallelize as expensive synchronization overhead easily offsets the advantage of parallelism. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive bottom-up approach to parallelize the BK algorithm. We first uniformly partition the graph into a number of regularly-shaped dis-joint subgraphs and process them in parallel, then we incre-mentally merge the subgraphs in an adaptive way to obtain the global optimum. The new algorithm has three benefits: 1) it is more cache-friendly within smaller subgraphs; 2) it keeps balanced workloads among computing cores; 3) it causes little overhead and is adaptable to the number of available cores. Extensive experiments in common applications such as 2D/3D image segmentations and 3D surface fitting demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:    This paper gives an overall account of a prototype  natural language question answering system  , called  Chat-80  .

Hitherto, smooth motion has been encouraged using a trajectory basis, yielding a hard combinatorial problem with time complexity growing exponentially in the number of frames. Branch and bound strategies have previously attempted to curb this complexity whilst maintaining global optimality. However, they provide no guarantee of being more efficient than exhaustive search. Inspired by recent work which reconstructs general trajectories using compact high-pass filters, we develop a dynamic programming approach which scales linearly in the number of frames, leveraging the intrinsically local nature of filter interactions. Extension to affine projection enables reconstruction without estimating cameras.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: In this paper, we aim to automatically render aging faces in a personalized way. Basically, a set of age-group specific dictionaries are learned, where the dictionary bases corresponding to the same index yet from different dictionaries form a particular aging process pattern cross different age groups, and a linear combination of these patterns expresses a particular personalized aging process. Moreover, two factors are taken into consideration in the dictionary learning process. First, beyond the aging dictionaries, each subject may have extra personalized facial characteristics, e.g. mole, which are invariant in the aging process. Second, it is challenging or even impossible to collect faces of all age groups for a particular subject, yet much easier and more practical to get face pairs from neighboring age groups. Thus a personality-aware coupled reconstruction loss is utilized to learn the dictionaries based on face pairs from neighboring age groups. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the advantages of our proposed solution over other state-of-the-arts in term of personalized aging progression, as well as the performance gain for cross-age face verification by synthesizing aging faces.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Fast algorithms for nearest neighbor (NN) search have in large part focused on 2 distance.

However, most existing techniques require expensive and laborious data annotation for model training. In this study, we propose to address this problem from three perspectives: (1) Instead of exhaustively annotating every single frame, the most informative frames are selected for annotation automatically and actively. (2) Rather than learning from only labelled data, the abundant unlabelled data are exploited. (3) Labelled data from other scenes are employed to further alleviate the burden for data annotation.

While current approaches are developed by only considering the low rank plus sparse structure, in many applications, side information of row and/or column entities may also be given, and it is still unclear to what extent could such information help robust PCA. Thus, in this paper, we study the problem of robust PCA with side information, where both prior structure and features of entities are exploited for recovery. We propose a convex problem to incorporate side information in robust PCA and show that the low rank matrix can be exactly recovered via the proposed method under certain conditions. In particular , our guarantee suggests that a substantial amount of low rank matrices, which cannot be recovered by standard robust PCA, become re-coverable by our proposed method. The result theoretically justifies the effectiveness of features in robust PCA. In addition, we conduct synthetic experiments as well as a real application on noisy image classification to show that our method also improves the performance in practice by exploiting side information.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We propose a  detection method  for orthographic variants caused by  transliteration  in a large  corpus .

One bottleneck in using BN is that learning the BN model parameters often requires a large amount of reliable and representative training data, which proves to be difficult to acquire for many computer vision tasks. On the other hand, there is often available qualitative prior knowledge about the model. Such knowledge comes either from domain experts based on their experience or from various physical or geometric constraints that govern the objects we try to model. Unlike the quantitative prior, the qualitative prior is often ignored due to the difficulty of incorporating them into the model learning process. In this paper, we introduce a closed-form solution to systematically combine the limited training data with some generic qualitative knowledge for BN parameter learning. To validate our method, we compare it with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation method under sparse data and with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm under incomplete data respectively. To further demonstrate its applications for computer vision, we apply it to learn a BN model for facial Action Unit (AU) recognition from real image data. The experimental results show that with simple and generic qualitative constraints and using only a small amount of training data, our method can robustly and accurately estimate the BN model parameters.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:   A deterministic parser  is under development which represents a departure from  traditional deterministic parsers  in that it combines both  symbolic and connectionist components .

For the generation of synthesized speech we used a state of the art HMM-based speech synthesis system. The noisy conditions comprised four additive noises. The measures were compared with subjective intelligibility scores obtained in listening tests. The results show the Dau and the glimpse measures to be the best predictors of intelligibility, with correlations of around 0.83 to subjective scores. All measures gave less accurate predictions of intelligibility for synthetic speech than have previously been found for natural speech; in particular the SII measure.

Moreover, a heuristic approach was commonly used to obtain translation invariance. In this paper we suggest an improved approach for learning such models and using them for human motion recognition. The suggested approach combines multiple cues, i.e., positions, velocities and appearance into both the learning and detection phases. Furthermore, we introduce global variables in the model, which can represent global properties such as translation, scale or viewpoint. The model is learned in an unsupervised manner from un-labelled data. We show that the suggested hybrid proba-bilistic model (which combines global variables, like translation , with local variables, like relative positions and appearances of body parts), leads to: (i) faster convergence of learning phase, (ii) robustness to occlusions, and, (iii) higher recognition rate.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  We present a  tool , called  ILIMP , which takes as input a  raw text  in  French  and produces as output the same  text  in which every occurrence of the  pronoun il  is tagged either with tag  [ANA]  for  anaphoric  or  [IMP]  for  impersonal  or  expletive .

In the case of known expert competence levels, we give sharp error estimates for the optimal rule. When the competence levels are unknown, they must be empirically estimated. We provide frequentist and Bayesian analyses for this situation. Some of our proof techniques are non-standard and may be of independent interest. The bounds we derive are nearly optimal, and several challenging open problems are posed.

As  unification-based grammatical frameworks  are extended to handle richer descriptions of  linguistic information , they begin to share many of the properties that have been developed in  KL-ONE-like knowledge representation systems . This commonality suggests that some of the  classification-based representation techniques  can be applied to  unification-based linguistic descriptions . This merging supports the integration of  semantic and syntactic information  into the same system, simultaneously subject to the same types of processes, in an efficient manner. The result is expected to be more  efficient parsing  due to the increased organization of knowledge.

This approach differs from other approaches to  WSI  in that it enhances the effect of the  one sense per collocation observation  by using triplets of  words  instead of pairs. The combination with a  two-step clustering process  using  sentence co-occurrences  as  features  allows for accurate results. Additionally, a novel and likewise automatic and  unsupervised evaluation method  inspired by Schutze's (1992) idea of evaluation of  word sense disambiguation algorithms  is employed.

However, for high-dimensional continuous-state tasks, it can be extremely difficult to build an accurate model, and thus often the algorithm returns a policy that works in simulation but not in real-life. The other extreme, model-free RL, tends to require infeasibly large numbers of real-life trials. In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm that requires only an approximate model, and only a small number of real-life trials. The key idea is to successively \"ground\" the policy evaluations using real-life trials, but to rely on the approximate model to suggest local changes. Our theoretical results show that this algorithm achieves near-optimal performance in the real system, even when the model is only approximate. Empirical results also demonstrate that---when given only a crude model and a small number of real-life trials---our algorithm can obtain near-optimal performance in the real system.\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT: Conventional HMMs have weak duration constraints. In noisy conditions, the mismatch between corrupted speech signals and models trained on clean speech may cause the decoder to produce word matches with unrealistic durations.

The expanded HMMs are compatible with conventional Viterbi decoding. Experiments on connected-digit recognition show that when using explicit duration constraints the decoder generates word matches with more reasonable durations, and word error rates are significantly reduced across a broad range of noise conditions .\n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  In this paper we present a novel, customizable :  IE paradigm  that takes advantage of  predicate-argument structures  .

First, a hypergraph is constructed to capture the correlations among different categories, in which each vertex represents one training instance and each hyperedge for one category contains all the instances belonging to the same category. Then, an improved SVM like learning system incorporating the hypergraph regularization, called Rank-HLapSVM, is proposed to handle the multi-label classification problems.

In this work, we encode actions based on attributes that describes actions as high-level concepts e.g., jump forward or motion in the air. We base our analysis on two types of action attributes. One type of action attributes is generated by humans. The second type is data-driven attributes, which are learned from data using dictionary learning methods. Attribute-based representation may exhibit high variance due to noisy and redundant attributes. We propose a discriminative and compact attribute-based representation by selecting a subset of discriminative attributes from a large attribute set. Three attribute selection criteria are proposed and formulated as a submodular optimization problem. A greedy optimization algorithm is presented and guaranteed to be at least (1-1/e)-approximation to the optimum.

The probability distribution of each class over the set of clusters is used to define a true set based similarity measure. To this end, we propose an iterative sparse spectral clustering algorithm. In each iteration, a proximity matrix is efficiently recomputed to better represent the local subspace structure. Initial clusters capture the global data structure and finer clusters at the later stages capture the subtle class differences not visible at the global scale. Image sets are compactly represented with multiple Grass-mannian manifolds which are subsequently embedded in Euclidean space with the proposed spectral clustering algorithm.

Contrary to most of the existing mixture of viewpoints models , our model establishes explicit correspondences of parts across different viewpoints of the object class.

The  parser  gains algorithmic efficiency through a  reduction  of its  search space  . As each new  edge  is added to the  chart  , the algorithm checks only the topmost of the  edges  adjacent to it, rather than all such  edges  as in conventional treatments. The resulting  spanning edges  are insured to be the correct ones by carefully controlling the order in which  edges  are introduced so that every final  constituent  covers the longest possible  span  . This is facilitated through the use of  phrase boundary heuristics  based on the placement of  function words  , and by  heuristic rules  that permit certain kinds of  phrases  to be deduced despite the presence of  unknown words  . A further  reduction in the search space  is achieved by using  semantic  rather than  syntactic categories  on the  terminal and non-terminal edges  , thereby reducing the amount of  ambiguity  and thus the number of  edges  , since only  edges  with a valid  semantic  interpretation are ever introduced. \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  This paper introduces a  system for categorizing unknown words .

ROD-TV simultaneously delivers good efficiency and robust-ness, by adapting to a continuum of primitive connectivity, view dependence, and levels of detail (LOD). Locally inferred surface elements are robust to noise and better capture local shapes. By inferring per-vertex normals at sub-voxel precision on the fly, we can achieve interpolative shading. Since these missing details can be recovered at the current level of detail, our result is not upper bounded by the scanning resolution. By relaxing the mesh connectivity requirement, we extend ROD-TV and propose a simple but effective multiscale feature extraction algorithm. ROD-TV consists of a hierarchical data structure that encodes different levels of detail. The local reconstruction algorithm is tensor voting. It is applied on demand to the visible subset of data at a desired level of detail , by traversing the data hierarchy and collecting tensorial support in a neighborhood.

In this theory,  discourse structure  is composed of three separate but interrelated components: the structure of the sequence of  utterances  (called the  linguistic structure  ), a structure of  purposes  (called the  intentional structure  ), and the state of  focus of attention  (called the  attentional state  ). The  linguistic structure  consists of segments of the  discourse  into which the  utterances  naturally aggregate. The  intentional structure  captures the  discourse-relevant purposes  , expressed in each of the  linguistic segments  as well as relationships among them. The  attentional state  is an abstraction of the  focus of attention  of the  participants  as the  discourse  unfolds. The  attentional state  , being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the  discourse  . The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such  discourse phenomena  as  cue phrases  ,  referring expressions  , and  interruptions  . The  theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances  is illustrated in the paper with a number of example  discourses  . Various properties of  discourse  are described, and explanations for the behaviour of  cue phrases  ,  referring expressions  , and  interruptions  are explored. This  theory  provides a framework for describing the processing of  utterances  in a  discourse  .  Discourse processing  requires recognizing how the  utterances  of the  discourse  aggregate into  segments  , recognizing the  intentions  expressed in the  discourse  and the relationships among  intentions  , and tracking the  discourse  through the operation of the mechanisms associated with  attentional state  .

The approach can easily be adapted to synthesize  bilingual or multi-lingual texts  . \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  In this paper, we compare the relative effects of  segment order  ,  segmentation  and  segment contiguity  on the  retrieval performance  of a  translation memory system  . We take a selection of both  bag-of-words and segment order-sensitive string comparison methods  , and run each over both  character- and word-segmented data  , in combination with a range of  local segment contiguity models  (in the form of  N-grams  ). Over two distinct  datasets  , we find that  indexing  according to simple  character bigrams  produces a  retrieval accuracy  superior to any of the tested  word N-gram models  . Further,in their optimum  configuration  ,  bag-of-words methods  are shown to be equivalent to  segment order-sensitive methods  in terms of  retrieval accuracy  , but much faster. We also provide evidence that our findings are scalable. \n","\n","\n","-----------------\n","-----------------\n","TEXT:  With performance above 97%  accuracy  for  newspaper text ,  part of speech (pos) tagging  might be considered a solved problem. Previous studies have shown that allowing the  parser  to resolve  pos tag ambiguity  does not improve performance. However, for  grammar formalisms  which use more  fine-grained grammatical categories , for example  tag  and  ccg ,  tagging accuracy  is much lower. In fact, for these  formalisms , premature  ambiguity resolution  makes  parsing  infeasible. We describe a  multi-tagging approach  which maintains a suitable level of  lexical category ambiguity  for accurate and efficient  ccg parsing . We extend this  multi-tagging approach  to the  pos level  to overcome errors introduced by automatically assigned  pos tags . Although  pos tagging accuracy  seems high, maintaining some  pos tag ambiguity  in the  language processing pipeline  results in more accurate  ccg supertagging . \n","erros de spans: 0\n"]}],"source":["#from auxiliares import train_test_split_total\n","#from conversao_json_spacy_completo import conversao_jsonl_spacy\n","\n","# Nesse trecho de código foi inserida a Validação Cruzada para Entidades\n","\n","TOTAL_JSONL_PATH = DATA_FILE_PATH_IN\n","PERCENT_SPLIT_TEST = 0.7\n","PERCENT_SPLIT_DEV = 0.3\n","\n","#Variável que permite dividir o conjunto de dados por X pedaços.\n","# Isto é, se tiver um arquivo com 1000 registros,\n","# e a varíavel estiver \"setada\" para 4, serão gerados 4 arquivos com 250 registros em cada.\n","NR_FOLDS = 1\n","\n","# São divididos o conjunto de dados em 3 partes (teste, treino e dev)\n","TEST_PATH = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/preanotetool/output/corpus_1_scierc-test\"\n","TRAIN_PATH =  \"/content/drive/MyDrive/preanotetool/output/corpus_1_scierc-train\"\n","DEV_PATH = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/preanotetool/output/corpus_1_scierc-dev\"\n","\n","# dev_jsonl_path = DEV_PATH + \".jsonl\"\n","# dev_spacy_path = DEV_PATH + \".spacy\"\n","# train_jsonl_path = TRAIN_PATH + \".jsonl\"\n","# train_spacy_path = TRAIN_PATH + \".spacy\"\n","\n","test_jsonl_path = TEST_PATH + \".jsonl\"\n","test_spacy_path = TEST_PATH + \".spacy\"\n","\n","\n","# Cria um arquivo temporário que não é utilizado\n","temp_path = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/preanotetool/output/exporta_anotacao-temp.jsonl\"\n","\n","# Separando conjunto de teste dos demais (temp)\n","train_test_split_total(TOTAL_JSONL_PATH, PERCENT_SPLIT_TEST, temp_path, test_jsonl_path)\n","\n","#REMOVIDO PARA FACILITAR DEPOIS TEM QUE SER REATIVADO\n","#train_test_split_total(TOTAL_JSONL_PATH, PERCENT_SPLIT_TEST, train_jsonl_path, test_jsonl_path)\n","\n","# Convertendo jsonl para spacy  (conjunto de teste)\n","#conversao_jsonl_spacy(train_jsonl_path, train_spacy_path)\n","\n","conversao_jsonl_spacy(test_jsonl_path, test_spacy_path)\n","####valida_conversao_jsonl_spacy(test_jsonl_path, test_spacy_path)\n","\n","#print(train_jsonl_path)\n","#print(test_jsonl_path)\n","\n","# Criando pares de conjuntos train+dev para cada fold\n","for fold in range(NR_FOLDS):\n","    print(fold)\n","\n","    train_jsonl_path_k = TRAIN_PATH + str(fold) + \".jsonl\"\n","    train_spacy_path_k = TRAIN_PATH + str(fold) + \".spacy\"\n","    dev_jsonl_path_k = DEV_PATH + str(fold) + \".jsonl\"\n","    dev_spacy_path_k = DEV_PATH + str(fold) + \".spacy\"\n","\n","    # Separando conjuntos train e dev\n","    train_test_split_total(temp_path, PERCENT_SPLIT_DEV, train_jsonl_path_k, dev_jsonl_path_k)\n","\n","    # Convertendo jsonl para spacy  (conjunto train)\n","    conversao_jsonl_spacy(train_jsonl_path_k, train_spacy_path_k)\n","\n","    # Convertendo jsonl para spacy  (conjunto dev)\n","    conversao_jsonl_spacy(dev_jsonl_path_k, dev_spacy_path_k)"]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","machine_shape":"hm","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
